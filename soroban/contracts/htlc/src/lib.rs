#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! WaffleFinance HTLC contract for Stellar (Soroban).
//!
//! This contract implements the Stellar side of the WaffleFinance cross-chain
//! bridge. It shares the same *logical* HTLC semantics as the Ethereum
//! `HTLCEscrow` contract — same hashlock scheme, same timelock direction,
//! same permissionless refund — but the *runtime semantics* differ in
//! several ways that both operators and auditors must understand:
//!
//! **Logical semantics (identical to Ethereum)**
//! - A sender locks `amount` of a Stellar asset under a `hashlock`
//!   (sha256(preimage)) and a `timelock`.
//! - Before the `timelock` the `beneficiary` can claim the locked
//!   amount by revealing the preimage.
//! - After the `timelock` anyone can call `refund_order` to return the
//!   locked amount to the original `refund_address` (typically the
//!   original sender).
//!
//! **Runtime semantics (Soroban-specific — different from EVM)**
//!
//! *Finality*: Stellar uses BFT consensus (Stellar Consensus Protocol).
//! Ledgers are final as soon as they close; there are no chain reorgs or
//! probabilistic confirmation windows.  The coordinator's listener guards
//! against node-level inconsistencies (stale cursors, out-of-order delivery)
//! but does NOT need to wait for confirmations the way an Ethereum listener
//! must.  Operators should not apply Ethereum-style "N confirmations" rules
//! to Soroban events.
//!
//! *Cryptography*: `sha256` is a Soroban host function call, not an EVM
//! precompile.  The hash function is identical (SHA-256), but the invocation
//! mechanism and gas accounting differ.
//!
//! *Event observability*: events are fetched via cursor-based pagination
//! (`getEvents` RPC call) rather than block-range `getLogs`.  Cursors are
//! opaque strings tied to the node's event history window (~48 h); a cursor
//! that falls outside the window is silently invalidated, triggering a
//! bounded replay in the coordinator.
//!
//! *State archival*: Soroban uses a rent-based TTL model.  Order entries and
//! the contract instance itself have finite lifetimes unless explicitly
//! extended.  See the "State archival (TTL) behaviour" section below.
//!
//! *Trust enforcement*: on Ethereum, the EVM bytecode is immutable once
//! deployed; correctness is enforced by the global EVM.  On Soroban, the
//! Soroban host enforces the same SHA-256 preimage check and timelock
//! invariants.  No address — including the coordinator or admin — can move
//! locked funds without satisfying these conditions, because the host
//! enforces it at the VM level, not just through contract logic.
//!
//! # Governance
//!
//! Configuration (admin, minimum safety deposit) is set atomically at
//! deploy time via the constructor, so adminship of a fresh deployment
//! cannot be front-run. Admin handover is two-step
//! (`transfer_admin` + `accept_admin`, with `revoke_pending_admin` as
//! an escape hatch) and every admin/config mutation emits an event
//! (`adm_xfer` / `cfg` topics) carrying the old and new values.
//!
//! # State archival (TTL) behaviour
//!
//! Soroban archives ledger entries whose TTL expires. For a
//! funds-holding contract this is a liveness hazard: an archived
//! `Order` entry makes `claim_order`/`refund_order` fail exactly when
//! funds are at stake, and an archived instance makes *every*
//! invocation fail until the instance is restored. This contract
//! manages TTLs so that neither happens in normal operation:
//!
//! - **Instance storage** (admin, order-id counter, config) is
//!   re-extended on every state-mutating entry point, so any activity
//!   keeps the contract alive for at least [`INSTANCE_TTL_EXTEND_TO`]
//!   ledgers (~30 days).
//! - **Order entries** get a TTL at creation derived from the order's
//!   own `timelock_seconds` (converted to ledgers assuming the
//!   fastest plausible ledger close time) plus a
//!   [`ORDER_TTL_MARGIN_LEDGERS`] safety margin (~14 days), so the
//!   entry outlives the claim window and the post-expiry refund
//!   window.
//! - `claim_order` / `refund_order` re-extend the entry when writing
//!   the terminal state, so claimed/refunded records stay queryable
//!   for indexers and reconciliation for ~30 days.
//! - [`HtlcContract::extend_order_ttl`] is a public, permissionless
//!   keep-alive: anyone can bump a live order's TTL if a claim window
//!   risks straddling an archival boundary (e.g. after a long period
//!   of network-wide TTL reductions).
//!
//! If an entry is archived anyway (e.g. the contract sits idle past
//! its instance TTL), no funds are lost: archived persistent and
//! instance entries can be restored with a standard
//! `RestoreFootprint` operation (paying the rent bump), after which
//! claim/refund proceed normally under the original hashlock +
//! timelock rules.
//!
//! # Migration framework
//!
//! See [`migration`] for the full migration design. In brief:
//!
//! - Every new deployment stamps the schema version via [`migration::stamp_initial_version`]
//!   so the `SchemaVersion` key is present from day one.
//! - Every state-reading entry point calls [`migration::require_current_schema`]
//!   before deserialising any `Order`, making schema mismatches loud rather
//!   than silent.
//! - [`HtlcContract::migrate_orders`] is an admin-only, batchable, resumable
//!   entry point that transforms persisted order data from an older schema
//!   version to the current one and emits an auditable `("migration","schema")`
//!   event on the final batch.
//! - [`HtlcContract::schema_version`] and [`HtlcContract::version_info`] are
//!   read-only helpers that let indexers detect schema state without a full
//!   contract call.
