#![cfg_attr(not(test), no_std)]
//! Open resolver registry for the WaffleFinance bridge.
//!
//! Resolvers stake a configurable amount of a chosen token to become
//! eligible to fill swap orders. Misbehaving resolvers can be slashed
//! by the registry admin (a contract role intended to be moved to a
//! DAO / multisig). Slashed funds go to a configurable beneficiary
//! (typically a community treasury).
//!
//! This contract intentionally does NOT make access-control decisions
//! for the HTLC itself — the HTLC is correct without the registry
//! (funds are always locked by hashlock + timelock). The registry is
//! a coordination layer: it lets the off-chain order book know which
//! resolvers have skin in the game.
//!
//! # Exit (unbonding) flow
//!
//! To prevent a misbehaving resolver from front-running a slash by
//! immediately unregistering, exits are two-phase:
//!
//! 1. **`request_unregister(resolver)`** — marks the resolver inactive
//!    immediately (`is_active` → false, so the HTLC registry gate
//!    rejects them) and records `unbond_ready_at = now + unbonding_period`.
//! 2. **`withdraw_stake(resolver)`** — only callable after
//!    `unbond_ready_at`; transfers remaining stake, removes the entry
//!    and list membership.
//!
//! The admin can update `unbonding_period` (lower-bounded at
//! `MIN_UNBONDING_PERIOD_SECS`, ≥ the 24 h max HTLC timelock).
//! Slashing remains fully effective during the unbonding window and
//! reduces the pending withdrawal amount.
//!
//! # Governance
//!
//! Configuration (admin, stake asset, minimum stake, slash
//! beneficiary, unbonding period) is set atomically at deploy time via
//! the constructor, so adminship of a fresh deployment cannot be
//! front-run. Admin handover is two-step (`transfer_admin` +
//! `accept_admin`, with `revoke_pending_admin` as an escape hatch) and
//! every admin/config mutation emits an event (`adm_xfer` / `cfg`
//! topics) carrying the old and new values.
//!
//! # Storage migration
//!
//! Existing `ResolverInfo` entries (deployed before this version) do
//! not carry `unbonding_at`. Such entries will deserialise as
//! `unbonding_at = 0` (Option<u64> = None), which is safe: both
//! `request_unregister` and `withdraw_stake` guard against the wrong
//! unbonding state. The `UnbondingPeriod` instance key is new; on a
//! first access it falls back to `DEFAULT_UNBONDING_PERIOD_SECS`.
